// Schema freeze until the defense (owner's standing rule, 11 Oct 2026):
// 28 tables + 1 view (ItemWantedCategorySummary), no new tables, views or
// columns. See AGENTS.md. Static: reads files only, no database, no server.
//
//   npx tsx scripts/verify-schema-freeze.ts
//
// What it pins:
//   1  prisma/schema.prisma declares exactly 28 models and no `view` block
//      (the one view is SQL-only, created by the migration named below)
//   2  each model's field count is what it was on 11 Oct 2026. A field line is
//      a column OR a relation field, so this also fails on a new relation;
//      that is deliberate, a new relation is a schema change to be asked about
//   3  the newest migration folder is still LAST_MIGRATION below, and the folder count is unchanged (so neither a
//      later folder nor a back-dated one slips in)
//
// If this fails because the owner APPROVED a change, update the pins in the
// same commit as the change and say so in the commit message.
