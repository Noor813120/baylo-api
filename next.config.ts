 * Development adds it: React's dev build calls eval() to rebuild call stacks,
 * and without it every dev page logs a CSP error (the "1 Issue" badge). `connect-src`
 * includes the Pusher endpoints the realtime client opens and the Nominatim
 * endpoint the pickup map geocodes against — anything not listed cannot be
 * reached from a page, which is what makes the policy worth having.
